This code supports
scientific manuscripts
that are in preparation.
It is released for transparency,
as an aid in understanding the work.
The code for specific papers
will be archived
at Zenodo.org
via forked GitHub repositories.
If someone can reuse the code
(after adjusting paths)
that is great,
but that is not the main goal here.
